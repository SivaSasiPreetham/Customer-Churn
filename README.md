**The Waze data team is currently developing a data analytics project aimed at increasing overall growth by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze app. For the purposes of this project, churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. The ultimate goal for this project is to develop a machine learning (ML) model that predicts user churn.**

  *As a part of the data team , starting with **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Data Visualization** , I performed a **Ttwo-sample Hypothesis Test** to analyze and determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between mean number of rides by Android users vs. iPhone users. I also used **Random Forest ML Algorithm** to predict user churn and then I used **XGBoost ML Algorithm** to improve the predicted scores.*
